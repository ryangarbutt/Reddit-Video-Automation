I made a confession post this morning about going on a dinner date with an escort to have someone to talk with. No sex or anything. Just dinner. 

The only person in my life I told was my best friend. I know he would never tell anyone else. But he is telling me(very kindly I should add) that he thinks what I did was wrong. He believes its disrespectful to my wife. 

I love this man and trust his judgement. Does he have a point here? This morning I got tons of support on reddit for my decision, but am second guessing myself here.
